This repository contains copies of coding projects.
Some are personal projects, and some are projects I've
been a part of during my studies. Below is a brief summary
of the contents, and a short description of the project in question.

Java:
  - Sisu - school group project
	> The student course service website sisu.fi reimagined as a
          Java based desktop app. The result of a group project of 3
          students. All of us contributed to the final product, but
          my most important responsibility was to take care of the UI,
          consisting of startup window, registration window, and main
          window. CSS formatting was also added to the UI by me.
  - App - school group project
	> A project for software design course. Some spftware design
	  principles, such as MVC, have been experimented with. The
	  idea of the program is to combine two APIs (traffic and weather),
	  and visually present them in the UI. My responsibility was to
	  connect visual elements to the functionality.

C++:
   - Compare_ingredients - personal project
	> A personal project of a program comparing the ingredients
          of two different skincare products. The list of products is predetermined,
	  consisting of a few skincare products currently in my use.
     	  The program is still ina very much sketch phase, but demonstrates the
	  abitlity to build C++ code from scratch.
